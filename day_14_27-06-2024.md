### Tasks Done:
Worked on creating a separate report for customer churn prediction.
Used machine learning algorithms in Power BI's AutoML to forecast potential churn rates.
Visualized the churn prediction results in the form of a dynamic dashboard.

### Notes:
- Worked from 10 AM to 3 PM.
- Applying predictive analytics is a new challenge, but I'm excited to learn more.
